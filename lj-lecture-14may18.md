    ## What was learned
      We learned about functions, CSS Box Model and layout, and JS Functions. We then looked at the next lab that was comming up.
   
    ## How will I use it.
      I will use this in various ways while programming and in web developing. 
        Functions can be used combine different actions and call them easier and more effecietly. Functions also help out when trouble shooting your code because you can elemenate the other functions and narrow it down to the main issue. CSS is what we use to style the page or program. it is the main thing that people see we learned how to more effecenitntly design pages and how to manipulate the layout to the way that we need it to be.
